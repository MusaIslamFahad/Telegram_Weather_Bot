## üß∞ Technologies Used

* **Python 3:** The core programming language.

## üîß How to Use

Follow these steps to set up and run your Telegram Weather Bot:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/telegram-weather-bot.git](https://github.com/your-username/telegram-weather-bot.git)
    cd telegram-weather-bot
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file in your project with `pyTelegramBotAPI` and `APScheduler` listed).

3.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    Before running the bot, you need to set up two environment variables:
    * `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram Bot token obtained from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
    * `WEATHER_API_KEY`: Your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

    **Example (Linux/macOS):**
    ```bash
    export BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    export WEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
    ```
    **Example (Windows - Command Prompt):**
    ```cmd
    set BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    set WEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
    ```
    (For persistent environment variables, refer to your operating system's documentation.)

4.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    Telegram Weather Bot.py
    ```

5.  **Interact with your Bot on Telegram:**
    * Send `/start` to begin receiving hourly weather updates.
    * Send `/stop` to stop receiving hourly weather updates.
    * Send `/test` to get an immediate weather report and check if the bot is running.

## üìå Future Improvements

* **Multi-city weather support:** Allow users to specify and receive weather updates for multiple cities.
* **Custom update intervals:** Enable users to set their preferred frequency for weather reports (e.g., every 3 hours, daily).
* **Forecast reports:** Provide hourly or daily forecast reports in addition to current weather.
* **Support for inline queries and buttons:** Enhance user interaction with inline queries for quick weather lookups and interactive buttons.
